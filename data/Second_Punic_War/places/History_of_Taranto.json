<a href='/wiki/Sparta' title='Sparta'>Spartan</a> colony, and its origin is peculiar: the founders were <a href='/wiki/Partheniae' title='Partheniae'>Partheniae</a>, sons of unmarried Spartan women and <i><a href='/wiki/Perioeci' title='Perioeci'>perioeci</a></i> (free men, but not citizens of Sparta); these unions were decreed by the Spartans to increase the number of soldiers (only the citizens of Sparta could become soldiers) during the bloody <a href='/wiki/Messenian_Wars' title='Messenian Wars'>Messenian Wars</a><sup class='plainlinks noprint Inline-Template' style='vertical-align:text-top;white-space:nowrap;'>[<i><a rel='nofollow' class='external text'

disambiguation. (March 2015)'>disambiguation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, but later they were nullified, and the sons were forced to leave. According to the legend <a href='/wiki/Phalanthus' title='Phalanthus'>Phalanthus</a>, the Parthenian leader, went to <a href='/wiki/Delphi' title='Delphi'>Delphi</a> to consult the <a href='/wiki/Sibyl' title='Sibyl'>oracle</a> and received the puzzling answer that he should found a city where rain fell from a clear sky. After all attempts to capture a suitable place to found a colony failed, he became despondent, convinced that the oracle had told him something that was impossible, and was consoled by his wife. She laid his head in her lap and herself became disconsolate. When Phalanthus felt her tears splash onto his forehead he at last grasped the meaning of the oracle, for his wife's name meant clear sky. The harbour of Taranto in Apulia was nearby and he decided this must be the new home for the exiles. The Partheniae arrived and founded the city, naming it <i>Taras</i> after the son of the Greek sea god, <a href='/wiki/Poseidon' title='Poseidon'>Poseidon</a>, and the local nymph Satyrion. A variation says Taras was founded in 707 BC by some Spartans, who, the sons of free women and enslaved fathers, were born during the Messenian War. According to other sources, <a href='/wiki/Heracles' title='Heracles'>Heracles</a> founded the city. Another tradition indicates <a href='/wiki/Taras_(mythology)' title='Taras (mythology)'>Taras</a> himself as the founder of the city; the symbol of the Greek city (as well as of the modern city) is Taras riding a dolphin. Taranto increased its power, becoming a commercial power and a sovereign city of <a href='/wiki/Magna_Graecia' title='Magna Graecia'>Magna Graecia</a>, ruling over the <a href='/wiki/Greek_colonies' class='mw-redirect' title='Greek colonies'>Greek colonies</a> in southern Italy.</p><p>In its beginning, Taranto was a monarchy, probably modelled on the one ruling over Sparta; according to <a href='/wiki/Herodotus' title='Herodotus'>Herodotus</a> (iii 136), around 492 BC king Aristophilides ruled over the city. The expansion of Taranto was limited to the coast because of the resistance of the populations of inner Apulia. In 472 BC, Taranto signed an alliance with <a href='/wiki/Rhegion' class='mw-redirect' title='Rhegion'>Rhegion</a>, to counter the <a href='/wiki/Iapygians' title='Iapygians'>Iapygian</a> tribes of the <a href='/wiki/Messapians' title='Messapians'>Messapians</a>, <a href='/wiki/Peucetians' title='Peucetians'>Peucetians</a>, and <a href='/wiki/Lucanians' title='Lucanians'>Lucanians</a> (see <a href='/wiki/Iapygian-Tarentine_Wars' title='Iapygian-Tarentine Wars'>Iapygian-Tarentine Wars</a>), but the joint armies of the Tarentines and Rhegines were defeated near <a href='/wiki/Ceglie_Messapica' title='Ceglie Messapica'>Kailia</a>, in what Herodotus<sup id='cite_ref-1' class='reference'><a href='#cite_note-1'>[1]</a></sup> claims to be the greatest slaughter of Greeks in his knowledge, with 3,000 Reggians and uncountable Tarentines killed. In 466 BC, Taranto was again defeated by the Iapygians; according to <a href='/wiki/Aristotle' title='Aristotle'>Aristotle</a>,<sup id='cite_ref-2' class='reference'><a href='#cite_note-2'>[2]</a></sup> who praises its government, there were so many aristocrats killed that the democratic party was able to get the power, to remove the monarchy, inaugurate a democracy, and expel the <a href='/wiki/Pythagoreanism' title='Pythagoreanism'>Pythagoreans</a>. Like Sparta, Tarentum was an aristocratic republic, but became democratic when the ancient nobility dwindled.</p><p>However, the rise of the democratic party did not weaken the bonds of Taranto and her mother-city Sparta. In fact, Taranto supported the Peloponnesian side against Athens in the <a href='/wiki/Peloponnesian_War' title='Peloponnesian War'>Peloponnesian War</a>, refused anchorage and water to Athens in 415 BC, and even sent ships to help the Peloponnesians, after the Athenian disaster in Sicily. On the other side, Athens supported the Messapians, in order to counter Taranto's power.</p><p>In 432 BC, after several years of war, Taranto signed a peace treaty with the Greek colony of <a href='/wiki/Thurii' title='Thurii'>Thurii</a>; both cities contributed to the foundation of the colony of <a href='/wiki/Heraclea_(Lucania)' class='mw-redirect' title='Heraclea (Lucania)'>Heraclea</a>, which rapidly fell under Taranto's control. In 367 BC <a href='/wiki/Carthage' title='Carthage'>Carthage</a> and the <a href='/wiki/Etruscans' class='mw-redirect' title='Etruscans'>Etruscans</a> signed a <a href='/wiki/Pact' title='Pact'>pact</a> to counter Taranto's power in southern Italy.</p><p>Under the rule of its greatest statesman, strategist and army commander-in-chief, the philosopher and mathematician <a href='/wiki/Archytas' title='Archytas'>Archytas</a>, Taranto reached its peak power and wealth; it was the most important city of the Magna Graecia, the main commercial port of southern Italy, it produced and exported goods to and from motherland Greece and it had the biggest army and the largest fleet in southern Italy. However, with the death of Archytas in 347 BC, the city started a slow, but ineluctable decline; the first sign of the city's decreased power was its inability to field an army, since the Tarentines preferred to use their large wealth to hire mercenaries, rather than leave their lucrative trades.</p><p>In 343 BC Taranto appealed for aid against the barbarians to its mother city Sparta, in the face of aggression by the Brutian League. In 342 BC, <a href='/wiki/Archidamus_III' title='Archidamus III'>Archidamus III</a>, king of Sparta, arrived in Italy with an army and a fleet to fight the Lucanians and their allies. In 338 BC, during the Battle of <a href='/wiki/Manduria' title='Manduria'>Manduria</a>, the Spartan and Tarentine armies were defeated in front of the walls of Manduria (nowadays in province of Taranto), and Archidamus was killed.</p><p>In 333 BC, still troubled by their Italic neighbours, the Tarentines called the <a href='/wiki/Epirus' title='Epirus'>Epirotic</a> king <a href='/wiki/Alexander_Molossus' class='mw-redirect' title='Alexander Molossus'>Alexander Molossus</a> to fight the <a href='/wiki/Bruttii' class='mw-redirect' title='Bruttii'>Bruttii</a>, <a href='/wiki/Samnites' title='Samnites'>Samnites</a>, and <a href='/wiki/Lucania' title='Lucania'>Lucanians</a>, but he was later (331 BC) defeated and killed in the battle of Pandosia (near <a href='/wiki/Cosenza' title='Cosenza'>Cosenza</a>). In 320 BC, a peace treaty was signed between Taranto and the Samnites. In 304 BC, Taranto was attacked by the <a href='/wiki/Lucania' title='Lucania'>Lucanians</a> and asked for the help of <a href='/wiki/Agathocles' title='Agathocles'>Agathocles</a> tyrant of <a href='/wiki/Syracuse,_Italy' class='mw-redirect' title='Syracuse, Italy'>Syracuse</a>, king of <a href='/wiki/Sicily' title='Sicily'>Sicily</a>. Agathocles arrived in southern Italy and took control of Bruttium (present-day <a href='/wiki/Calabria' title='Calabria'>Calabria</a>), but was later recalled to Syracuse. In 303 BC-302 BC Cleonymus of Sparta established an alliance with Taranto against the Lucanians, and fought against them.</p><p>Arnold J. Toynbee, a classical scholar who taught at Oxford and other prestigious English universities and who did original and definitive work on Sparta (e.g. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. xxxiii 1913 p.&#160;246-275) seemed to have some doubts about Tarentum (Taranto) being of Spartan origin.</p><p>In his book The Study of History vol. iii p.&#160;52 he wrote: '...Tarentum, which claimed a Spartan origin; but, even if this claim was in accordance with historical fact...' The tentative phrasing seems to imply that the evidence is neither conclusive or even establishes a high degree of probability of the truth that Tarentum (Taranto) was a Spartan colony.</p><h3><span class='mw-headline' id='Wars_against_Rome'>Wars against Rome</span><span class='mw-editsection'><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>[</span><a href='/w/index.php?title=History_of_Taranto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3' title='Edit section: Wars against Rome'>edit</a><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>]</span></span></h3><h4><span class='mw-headline' id='First_confrontations'>First confrontations</span><span class='mw-editsection'><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>[</span><a href='/w/index.php?title=History_of_Taranto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4' title='Edit section: First confrontations'>edit</a><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>]</span></span></h4><p>At the beginning of the 3rd century BC <a href='/wiki/Rome' title='Rome'>Rome</a>'s increasing power started to frighten Taranto, especially in terms of mastery of the sea and control over the Greek colonies in Magna Graecia. After the surrender of the <a href='/wiki/Samnites' title='Samnites'>Samnites</a> in 290 BC, the Romans founded many colonies in <a href='/wiki/Apulia' title='Apulia'>Apulia</a> and <a href='/wiki/Lucania' title='Lucania'>Lucania</a>. Furthermore, some of the city-states in Magna Graecia, such as <a href='/wiki/Rhegion' class='mw-redirect' title='Rhegion'>Rhegion</a>, <a href='/wiki/Crotone' title='Crotone'>Croton</a> and <a href='/wiki/Locri' title='Locri'>Locri</a>, asked Rome for military help because of the wars that they were having with their neighbours. Also, <a href='/wiki/Thurii' title='Thurii'>Thurii</a>, which was located on the Gulf of Taranto and under Tarentine rule, asked Rome for help in 282 BC, after being attacked by Lucanians. This situation inevitably led to a conflict between Taranto and Rome, since Taranto felt Rome was interfering in the affairs of the Greek colonies in southern Italy, which the Tarentines considered under their dominion.</p><p>Two political parties were present at the time within Taranto. The <a href='/wiki/Democracy' title='Democracy'>democrats</a>, led by Philocharis or Ainesias, were dominant; they were against Rome, because they knew that if the Romans entered Taranto, the Greeks would have lost their independence. The second faction in Taranto were the <a href='/wiki/Aristocracy' title='Aristocracy'>aristocrats</a>, led by Agis; they had lost their power when Taranto had become a democracy, and did not oppose surrendering to Rome as it would increase their own influence in the city, by reducing the power of the democrats. However, the aristocrats did not want to surrender openly to Rome and become unpopular with the population.</p><p>At that time, Taranto had the most powerful naval forces in Italy, and hastened to come to an agreement with <a href='/wiki/Rome' title='Rome'>Rome</a> that stated that Roman ships could not enter into the <a href='/wiki/Gulf_of_Taranto' title='Gulf of Taranto'>Gulf of Taranto</a>.</p><p>In 282 BC, Rome sent a fleet under Admiral Lucius Valerius, carrying troops to garrison Thurii, but ten ships were caught in a tempest and arrived in the sea off Taranto during a holy day (the festival of <a href='/wiki/Dionysus' title='Dionysus'>Dionysus</a>). This angered the Tarentines, who considered it a hostile act openly in conflict with the pact, which forbade the Gulf of Taranto to Roman ships, and responded by attacking the Roman fleet: the Tarentine navy sunk four Roman ships, and captured a fifth.<sup id='cite_ref-3' class='reference'><a href='#cite_note-3'>[3]</a></sup> According to some historians, Tarentine aristocrats had been asked by the Roman commanders Publius Cornelius and Lucius Valerius to arrest and execute the democrats and their followers during the arrival of the Roman fleet, which would allow the aristocrats to lead the city and sign an alliance with Rome.</p><p>The army and fleet of Taranto moved to Thurii and helped the democrats there exile the aristocrats. The Roman garrison placed in Thurii withdrew.</p><h4><span class='mw-headline' id='Pyrrhic_War'>Pyrrhic War</span><span class='mw-editsection'><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>[</span><a href='/w/index.php?title=History_of_Taranto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5' title='Edit section: Pyrrhic War'>edit</a><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>]</span></span></h4><div role='note' class='hatnote'>Main article: <a href='/wiki/Pyrrhic_War' title='Pyrrhic War'>Pyrrhic War</a></div><div class='thumb tleft'><div class='thumbinner' style='width:202px;'><a href='/wiki/File:Rome_against_Taranto_location.png' class='image'><img alt='' src='//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Rome_against_Taranto_location.png/200px-Rome_against_Taranto_location.png' width='200' height='190' class='thumbimage' srcset='//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Rome_against_Taranto_location.png 1.5x' data-file-width='253' data-file-height='240' /></a><div class='thumbcaption'><div class='magnify'><a href='/wiki/File:Rome_against_Taranto_location.png' class='internal' title='Enlarge'></a></div>Most important places of the wars against Rome</div></div></div><p>Rome sent diplomats to Taranto, but the talks were broken off by the Tarentines: the Roman ambassador, Postumius, was insulted and mocked by Philonides, a member of the popular party. The Senate declared war on Taranto, and the Tarentines decided to call for help from King <a href='/wiki/Pyrrhus_of_Epirus' title='Pyrrhus of Epirus'>Pyrrhus of Epirus</a>. In 281 BC, Roman legions, under the command of <a href='/wiki/Lucius_Aemilius_Barbula' title='Lucius Aemilius Barbula'>Lucius Aemilius Barbula</a>, entered Taranto and plundered it. Taranto, with Samnite and Salentinian reinforcements, then lost a battle against the Romans. After the battle, the Greeks chose Agis to sign a truce and begin diplomatic talks. These talks were also broken off when 3000 soldiers from Epirus under the command of <a href='/wiki/Cineas' title='Cineas'>Cineas</a> entered the town. The Roman consul withdrew and suffered losses from attacks by the Greek ships.<sup id='cite_ref-4' class='reference'><a href='#cite_note-4'>[4]</a></sup></p><p>Pyrrhus decided to help Taranto because he was in debt to them - they had earlier helped him conquer the island of <a href='/wiki/Corcyra' class='mw-redirect' title='Corcyra'>Corcyra</a>. He also knew that he could count on help from the Samnites, Lucanians, Bruttii, and some <a href='/wiki/Illyrian_tribes' class='mw-redirect' title='Illyrian tribes'>Illyrian tribes</a>. His ultimate goal was to conquer <a href='/wiki/Macedon' class='mw-redirect' title='Macedon'>Macedon</a>, but he did not have enough money to recruit soldiers. He planned to help Taranto, then go to <a href='/wiki/Sicily' title='Sicily'>Sicily</a> and attack <a href='/wiki/Carthage' title='Carthage'>Carthage</a>. After winning a war against Carthage and capturing southern Italy, he would have enough money to organise a strong army and capture Macedon.</p><p>Before he left Epirus, he borrowed some <a href='/wiki/Macedonian_phalanx' title='Macedonian phalanx'>phalanxes</a> from the Macedonian king, and demanded ships and money from the <a href='/wiki/Syria' title='Syria'>Syrian</a> king Antiochus and from <a href='/wiki/Antigonus_II_Gonatas' title='Antigonus II Gonatas'>Antigonus II Gonatas</a> . The <a href='/wiki/Egypt' title='Egypt'>Egyptian</a> king also promised to send 9000 soldiers and 50 <a href='/wiki/War_elephants' class='mw-redirect' title='War elephants'>war elephants</a>. These forces had to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus was gone. He recruited soldiers in Greece as well, as the Greek cities wanted to avoid a war with Epirus, even though they were unconcerned with the Greek colonies in Italy. In the spring of 280 BC, Pyrrhus landed without losses in Italy. He had 20,000 infantry (pikemen from Epirus and Macedonia, mercenary hoplites from around Greece, and peltasts), 500 slingers, 2,000 archers, 3,000 elite cavalry from <a href='/wiki/Thessaly' title='Thessaly'>Thessaly</a>, and 20 war elephants.</p><p>After hearing of Pyrrhus' arrival in Italy, the Romans mobilized eight legions with auxiliaries, totalling about 80 000 soldiers, and divided into four armies. Valerius Levinus marched to Taranto, with an army of 30,000 <a href='/wiki/Roman_legion' title='Roman legion'>legionnaires</a> and auxiliaries. Pyrrhus moved from Taranto to meet its allies, but met with the Roman army, and decided to fight it next to <a href='/wiki/Heraclea_(Lucania)' class='mw-redirect' title='Heraclea (Lucania)'>Heraclea</a>. The <a href='/wiki/Battle_of_Heraclea' title='Battle of Heraclea'>Battle of Heraclea</a> was won by Pyrrhus, but the casualties were very high. Upon his arrival in Italy, Pyrrhus thought that the Roman army would be easily defeated by his Macedonian phalanx. However, Roman legions proved to be stronger than expected. Furthermore, Rome was able to raise a large number of legions, while Pyrrhus was far from home and had only a handful of veterans with him.</p><p>Pyrrhus moved towards Rome with the intention of rallying the peoples ruled by the Romans and conquering the city, but he had no success in this and was forced to return to Apulia.</p><p>In 279 BC, Pyrrhus defeated another Roman army in the <a href='/wiki/Battle_of_Asculum' title='Battle of Asculum'>Battle of Asculum</a> (modern Ascoli Satriano, <a href='/wiki/Province_of_Foggia' title='Province of Foggia'>Foggia</a>), again with many casualties. Most of the men Pyrrhus had brought over from Epirus were disabled or dead, including nearly all of his officers and friends. Recruiting would be impossible, and his allies were unreliable. The Romans, on the other hand, quickly replaced their losses with fresh men, and with every defeat, the Romans were becoming more determined to win. At the same time, Pyrrhus received a proposal from the Sicilian Greek colonies of Syracuse, Leontini, and Agrigentum, to lead them in a war against the Carthaginians, and left Italy for Sicily, suspending the war against Rome, and leaving a garrison in Taranto.</p><p>The Tarentines recalled Pyrrhus in 276 BC, and the king gladly returned from his Sicilian adventure. The war against Rome revamped, but this time Pyrrhus was matched by the Romans in the <a href='/wiki/Battle_of_Beneventum_(275_BC)' title='Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)'>Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)</a> and elected to give up his Italian campaign as Antigonus II of Macedon would not send him reinforcements. After six years, Pyrrhus returned to Epirus, with only 8,500 men: a garrison was left in Taranto, under the command of Pyrrhus' vice-commander Milon.</p><p>The Romans conquered the city in 272 BC, by treachery of the <a href='/wiki/Greeks' title='Greeks'>Greek</a> soldiers, and demolished the defensive walls of the city. Thirty thousand of the Greek inhabitants were sold as slaves and many works of art were carried off to Rome.</p><h4><span class='mw-headline' id='Second_Punic_War'>Second Punic War</span><span class='mw-editsection'><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>[</span><a href='/w/index.php?title=History_of_Taranto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6' title='Edit section: Second Punic War'>edit</a><span class='mw-editsection-bracket'>]</span></span></h4><div class='thumb tright'><div class='thumbinner' style='width:227px;'><a href='/wiki/File:Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg' class='image'><img alt='' src='//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg/225px-Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg' width='225' height='111' class='thumbimage' srcset='//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg/338px-Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg/450px-Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg 2x' data-file-width='500' data-file-height='246' /></a><div class='thumbcaption'><div class='magnify'><a href='/wiki/File:Tarentum_Hannibal.jpg' class='internal' title='Enlarge'></a></div>Coin struck during the Punic occupation.

However, a group of Tarentine hostages held in Rome were caught trying to escape and thrown from the <i><a href='/wiki/Tarpeian_Rock' title='Tarpeian Rock'>Tarpeian Rock</a></i> as traitors; probably because of this, anti-Roman feeling in the city increased greatly. Two members of the pro-Carthage faction in the city enabled Hannibal to enter the city in 212 BC, although he was not able to capture the citadel of the city which was defended by Roman troops. Because of Hannibal's failure to capture the citadel, he was not able to use Tarentum as a major port and staging area for the invasion of Italy. The army was forced to portage boats across the city in order to sail from the bay.
